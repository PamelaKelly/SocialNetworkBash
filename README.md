## Project Title: Social Network in Bash
#### Project Description: This project is solely concerned with the backend
functionality associated with the most basic social network. It is not 
concerned with user interface or graphics. The focus is to explore concepts 
such as synchronisation - where the shared resources in questions are users' 
walls, friends lists etc. 
The project is conducted in bash as part of a module in Operating Systems 
where one of the key focuses of the course was to become familiar with 
Linux systems, and to learn to program for systems through Bash.
